# Sidebar Menu with Dark/Light Mode  

Welcome to my first published GitHub project!  

This is a simple yet functional **Sidebar Menu** built using **HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript**. The menu includes a **Dark/Light Mode toggle** and consists of multiple navigation links aligned vertically on the left side of the webpage.  

Feel free to use or improve it 👍.
